// RetentionIndex represents an abstract notion of system progress used in garbage collection.
// The basic idea is to associate various parts of the system (parts of the state, even whole modules)
// that are subject to eventual garbage collection with a retention index.
// As the system progresses, the retention index monotonically increases
// and parts of the system associated with a lower retention index can be garbage-collected.
