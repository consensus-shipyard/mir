# Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

Here we document Mir's architecture decisions. Each file corresponds to a single decision made, roughly following
[Michael Nygard's blog post](https://cognitect.com/blog/2011/11/15/documenting-architecture-decisions)
and (starting at ) the [MADR project](https://adr.github.io/madr/).
Each decision records, along its clear statement, the context in which it was made and its expected consequences.

To create a new ADR, use the [template file](adr-template.md).

When an ADR is added or updated, the following table of contents must manually be updated as well.

## Table of contents

- [ADR-0001](0001-node-and-client-id-types.md) - Node and client ID types (Accepted Apr 21, 2022)
