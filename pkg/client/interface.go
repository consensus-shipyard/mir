// The Client represents an SMR client that produces new transactions (using NewTX)
// that can be submitted to the SMR system.
// It sequentially assigns transaction numbers to all created transactions.
// The Client is informed (using Done)
// when a transaction is considered applied (or otherwise safe to stop caring about).
// All created transactions that have not been confirmed this way are considered pending.
// The client is expected to persistently store all pending transactions,
// in case they need to be resubmitted after recovering from a potential crash.

	// the transaction will be pending, i.e., among the transactions returned by Pending.
